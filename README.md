# QR Code Card Project

## Description
This project is a simple and elegant card-style UI featuring a QR code image, a title, and a brief description. The design is built using HTML and CSS with a modern gradient background.

## Features
- Responsive and centered card layout.
- Beautiful gradient background.
- Rounded corners for a smooth UI.
- Mobile-friendly and minimalistic design.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3 (including Flexbox and gradients)

## How to Use
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Place your QR code image in the same directory as `index.html`.
3. Open the `index.html` file in a browser to view the QR Code Card.

## File Structure
```
project-folder/
│-- index.html  # Main HTML file
│-- qr.jpg      # QR Code image
│-- README.md   # Project documentation
```

## How It Works
- The `container` class centers the card in the viewport.
- The `box` class styles the card with padding, border-radius, and a flexbox layout.
- The image is styled to fit neatly inside the card with rounded corners.
- The heading and paragraph provide context and instructions.

## Customization
- Replace `qr.jpg` with your own QR code image.
- Modify the text inside the `<h2>` and `<p>` elements to suit your needs.
- Adjust the CSS styles for different colors, fonts, or sizes.
